Yet another ruby chip8 emulator

broad goals:
1. make it easy to implement new instructions as needed
2. decouple frame creation and rendering (keep a framebuffer and only load frames at a fixed configurable(maybe) rate)
3. keep screen drawing and input directives seperate from the core implementation to allow for more extensibility

stretch goals: (in no particular order)
1. make it work with natalie
2. make it easily distributable
