Yet another ruby chip8 emulator

broad goals:
1. make it easy to implement new instructions as needed
2. decouple frame creation and rendering (keep a framebuffer and only load frames at a fixed configurable(maybe) rate)
3. keep screen drawing and input directives seperate from the core implementation to allow for more extensibility
4. make the component definition more generic (registers etc.)

stretch goals: (in no particular order)
1. make it work with natalie
2. make it easily distributable
